# Explain

Answer questions about concepts, patterns, architecture, or decisions.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search Knowledge (BLOCKING)

```bash
npx superintent search "<intent>" --limit 5
```

Extract key terms from user's question for query.

**Semantic Search:** ≥0.45 relevant, ≥0.55 strong. Don't discard low scores.

### Step 2: Answer

**Knowledge found (score ≥0.45):**

Synthesize explanation from knowledge. Cite: "Based on [title]...". Include code locations if mentioned.

**No codebase exploration.** Knowledge is the authoritative answer. STOP here.

---

**No knowledge found (all scores <0.45):**

Explore codebase to answer. After answering, suggest `/learn` if the topic is worth capturing.
